<h1>The Best Movies According to Chetan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>What I love about this movie is literally everything, from production point of view to the direction of Christopher Nolan! This movie hits all the right spots!</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>What a movie! Obviously not for everyone, it is for a niche audience. Really cool autobiography!</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Cult Classic! Fell in love with this movie the first time I watched it and I've watched it about 30 times already!</p>
